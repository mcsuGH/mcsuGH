A recent graduate from Makers Academy (March 2022 Cohort) - a bootcamp which allowed me to grow from an aspiring developer who knew very little about coding in to a more competent developer, who now realises there is still much to learn about coding. Thanks to the course, I have built a solid foundation in software development, developed good practices in programming and have experienced working in different tech stacks with different teams whilst working with agile processes.
